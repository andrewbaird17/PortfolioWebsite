						<p>
							<br />My name is Andrew Baird. I am graduate from devCodeCamp
							based <br />in Milwaukee, WI where I learned to be a full-stack
							software developer.
							<br />
							<br />Prior to this I graduated from the University of
							Wisconsin-Madison <br />with a Bachelors of Science in Atmospheric
							and Oceanic Sciences with <br />a minor in Environmental Studies.
							<br />Weather has always been a hobby of mine for as long as I can
							remember. <br />Throughout my entire life, I have been challenged
							to points I had never <br />imagined before and been able to
							persevere and overcome these challenges. <br />Coding is one of
							these challenges. It is always giving me new challenges that
							<br />are driving me towards finding a solution. <br />I have
							experience in the following languages and skills: <br />ASP.NET
							Core, C#, MVC, SQL, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, React, and learning
							more whenever I get a chance.
							<br />
							<br />If you would like to get in contact with me with any
							questions, <br />Head over to the
							<a href="contact.html">Contact Me</a> portion of the site.
